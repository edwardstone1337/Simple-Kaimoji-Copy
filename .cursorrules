## Pre-ship checklist (mandatory before completing any task)
- [ ] Read all user-visible copy — no developer jargon, placeholder text, or "SEO" references
- [ ] Confirm GA tracking (G-JKEBQ0M6NQ) is present on any new or modified HTML pages
- [ ] Run generate-seo-pages.js if any template or shared component changes were made
- [ ] Remove console.log and debug statements
- [ ] Verify changes don't break dark mode (even if dark mode isn't the focus)
- [ ] Run ship-check.sh and confirm PASS
- [ ] Provide a status report listing every file modified, selectors/functions changed, and any concerns
